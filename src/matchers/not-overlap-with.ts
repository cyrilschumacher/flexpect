/**
 * Asserts that the target element does not overlap with the reference element.
 *
 * This matcher checks whether the bounding boxes of the target element and the reference
 * element intersect. If there is any overlap, the matcher fails and provides detailed
 * information about the intersection area and dimensions.
 *
 * The function is useful for verifying layout constraints where elements should remain
 * visually separated, such as avoiding collisions between buttons, modals, or other UI components.
 *
 * @param target - The element as a {@link Locator} whose overlap is checked.
 * @param reference - The element as a {@link Locator} relative to which overlap is checked.
 * @returns A {@link Promise} that resolves with the matcher result.
 *
 * @example
 * // Checks that a tooltip does not overlap a button
 * await expect(tooltip).toNotOverlapWith(button);
